# Download all media files from any Wikipedia page

Python program to download all the images, videos and music files linked in a Wikipedia page

The only input it takes in the terminal is the URL of the Wikipedia Page.

As it uses BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries, I recommend running them in the Anaconda terminal.

As of now it just downloads images. I will add code for music and videos later in an update.

The media is downloaded in the same folder as the one in which the python file is located.
