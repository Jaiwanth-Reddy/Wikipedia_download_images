# Download all media files from any Wikipedia page

Python program to download all the images, videos and music files linked in a Wikipedia page

The only input it takes in the terminal is the URL of the Wikipedia Page.

As it uses BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries, I recommend running them in the Anaconda terminal.

As of now it just downloads images and music. I will add code for videos later in an update.

All the images and videos are downloaded in the highest res available, not the thumbnail size shown in the article.

The media is downloaded in the same folder as the one in which the python file is located.

Wikipedia already has the option of downloading the text of the article in pdf. So my final update probably will be a single python program which downloads- 
1. Images
2. Videos
3. Audio
4. Text as PDF
