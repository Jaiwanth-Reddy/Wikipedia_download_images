# Wikipedia_download_images
Python program to download all the images linked in a Wikipedia page

The only input it takes in the terminal is the URL of the Wikipedia Page.

As it uses BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries, I recommend running them in the Anaconda terminal. 

As of now it just downloads .svg files, I will update it to incorporate all image formats.
